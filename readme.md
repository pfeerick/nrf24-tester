# nrf24-tester [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pfeerick/nrf24-tester.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pfeerick/nrf24-tester)

nRF24L01+ test unit. Runs from a lithium battery, has charge, protectoin and fuel guage monitoring circuitry for the battery. Has a OLED display for output, and two push button for input. Has a socket for a nrf24L01+ 2.4Ghz transceiver.

I created and use this module to test different nrf24L01+ modules and setups.
